You need a for loop to loop through each of the letters in the plain_text. \n  2. Find the position of each letter in the alphabet List\n3. Add the user desired shift_amount to the position to get the position of the encoded letter.\n4. Find the corresponding letter for that position.\n5. Add each encoded letter to a new string and print it out after the loop ends.\n\n</div>\n\n\n### TODO-3: \nCall the `encrypt()` function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.\n\n\n### TODO-4: \nWhat happens if you try to shift the letter 'z' forwards by 9? Can you fix the code?\n\n<div class=\"hint\">\n  There are many approaches to do this.\n1. You can add more than 1 set of the alphabet into the List of alphabet letters.\n2. You can shift the shift_amount so that it is always within 0 - 25 and fits in the List.\n3. You can use the modulo to get the remainder.\n</div>\n\n","tokenCount":456,"range":{"start":0,"end":1799}}]}
