If we wanted the computer to print out 1 through to 100, it would very painful to type a print statement for every number, or even just typing out all the numbers 1 through to 100. Loops allow us to create a rule and the computer can follow it to do a repeated action.\n\n### Syntax\n\n```\nfor <variable name of each item> in <a List>:\n    <do something>\n    <do something else> \n```\n\n### PAUSE 1 - Be a Computer\nPredict what will be printed from the code below:\n\n```\nfruits = [\"Apple\", \"Peach\", \"Pear\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n    print(fruit + \" pie\")\n```\n\n### Indentation\nIndentation is very important in Python programming. Every time you see the `:` symbol used, you need to be careful about the indentation that comes afterwards.\n\ne.g. This code will behave very differently\n\n```\nfruits = [\"Apple\", \"Peach\", \"Pear\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n    print(\"Hello\")\n```\n\nfrom this code:\n\n```\nfruits = [\"Apple\", \"Peach\", \"Pear\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\nprint(\"Hello\")\n```","tokenCount":279,"range":{"start":0,"end":1100}}]}
