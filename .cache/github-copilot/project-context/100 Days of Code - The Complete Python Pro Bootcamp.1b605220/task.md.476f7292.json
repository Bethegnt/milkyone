Try it out and see if you can get it to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\n### PAUSE 1 \nTODO: Write out the other 3 functions - subtract, multiply and divide.\n\n### PAUSE 2\nTODO: Add these 4 functions into a dictionary as the values. Keys = \"`+`\", \"`-`\", \"`*`\", \"`/`\"\n\n### PAUSE 3\nTODO: Use the dictionary operations to perform the calculations. Multiply 4 * 8 using the dictionary.\n\n\n### Functionality\n- Program asks the user to type the first number.\n- Program asks the user to type a mathematical operator (a choice of \"`+`\", \"`-`\", \"`*`\" or \"`/`\")\n- Program asks the user to type the second number.\n- Program works out the result based on the chosen mathematical operator.\n- Program asks if the user wants to continue working with the previous result.\n- If yes, program loops to use the previous result as the first number and then repeats the calculation process.\n- If no, program asks the user for the fist number again and wipes all memory of previous calculations.\n- Add the logo from art.py\n\n<div class=\"hint\">\n  Try writing out a flowchart to plan your program.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"hint\">\n    To call multiplication from the operations dictionary, you would write your code like this:\n\n<code>result = operations[\"*\"](n1= 5, n2= 3)</code>\n\nresult would then be equal to 15.\n</div>\n\n\n","tokenCount":441,"range":{"start":0,"end":1807}}]}
