Instead of looping through each item in a List, we can loop through a range of numbers.\n\n### Range Function\n\n`range(1, 10)`\n\nThis code doesn't do anything by itself. For example, if you tried to print it, it would not give you individual numbers.\n\nBut it can be used in conjunction with For Loops. e.g.\n\n```\nfor number in range(1, 10):\n    print(number)\n```\n\nThis will print out each of the numbers 1 - 9. So the range can also be expressed like this:\n\n`a <= range(a, b) < b`\n\nWhere the range of numbers is inclusive of the lower bound but not inclusive of the upper bound.\n\n### PAUSE 1 - The Gauss Challenge\nWork out the total of the numbers between 1 and 100, inclusive of both 1 and 100.\n\n\n","tokenCount":206,"range":{"start":0,"end":814}}]}
