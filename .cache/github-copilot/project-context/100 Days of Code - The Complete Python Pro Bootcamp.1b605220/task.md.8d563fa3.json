Use your knowledge about Python lists and loops to complete the challenge.\n\n### Demo\nhttps://appbrewery.github.io/python-day5-demo/\n\n### Easy Version\nGenerate the password in sequence. Letters, then symbols, then numbers. If the user wants\n\n4 letters\n2 symbols and\n3 numbers\nthen the password might look like this:\n\n`fgdx$*924`\n\nYou can see that all the letters are together. All the symbols are together and all the numbers follow each other as well. Try to solve this problem first.\n\n<div class=\"hint\">\n  Remember you can use the random.choice() function to get a random item from a List! But you need to import the random module first.\n</div>\n\n\n### Hard Version\nWhen you've completed the easy version, you're ready to tackle the hard version. In the advanced version of this project the final password does not follow a pattern. So the example above might look like this:\n\n`x$d24g*f9`\n\nAnd every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different. This will make the password more difficult for hackers to crack.\n\nThe essential skill of a good programmer is using Google to find what you need. Your brain is for thinking, not memorising functions! You will need to Google to solve this project on the hard level. If you get stuck, check the hint below for what to Google.\n\n<div class=\"hint\">\n  Try googling: \"How to shuffle items in a List in Python\"\n</div>\n","tokenCount":362,"range":{"start":0,"end":1657}}]}
