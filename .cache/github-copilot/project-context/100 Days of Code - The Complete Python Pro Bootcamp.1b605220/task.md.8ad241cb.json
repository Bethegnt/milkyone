It's a data structure that allows us to associate a key to a value and pair the two pieces of data together.\n\nThis is how you create a dictionary in Python:\n```\n# An example dictionary\ncolours = {\n    \"apple\": \"red\", \n    \"pear\": \"green\", \n    \"banana\": \"yellow\"\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is how you retrieve items from a dictionary:\n```\nprint(colours[\"pear\"])\n#Will print \"green\"\n```\n\nThis is how to create an empty dictionary:\n```\nmy_empty_dictionary = {}\n```\n\nThis is how you can add new items to an existing dictionary:\n\n```\ncolours[\"peach\"] = \"pink\"\n```\n\nThis is also how you can edit an existing value in a dictionary:\n```\ncolours[\"apple\"] = \"green\"\n```\n\nThis is how to loop through a dictionary and print all the keys:\n```\nfor key in colours:\n    print(key)\n```\n\nThis is how to loop through a dictionary and print all the values:\n```\nfor key in colours:\n    print(colours[key])\n```","tokenCount":236,"range":{"start":0,"end":948}}]}
