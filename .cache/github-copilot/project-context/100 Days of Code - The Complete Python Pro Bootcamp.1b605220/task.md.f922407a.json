The first condition has to fail to go into the elif and the elif (or multiple elif) have to fail to go into the else. Condition 2 is only checked if condition 1 is false.\n\nIn the nested if statements, A, B and C can all happen, but conditions 1, 2 and 3 must all be true. The computer will only check condition 2 if condition 1 is true.\n\nIn the multiple if statements, A, B, and C can all happen. But they are completely independent of each other. C can happen even if A and B don't. Every condition is checked, no matter the result of the others.\n","tokenCount":335,"range":{"start":0,"end":1221}}]}
