Functions that can have outputs.\n\n### PAUSE 1\nCreate a function called `format_name()` that takes two inputs: `f_name` and `l_name'.\n\n### PAUSE 2\nUse the `title()` function to modify the `f_name` and `l_name` parameters into Title Case.\n\n### Syntax\nYou can create a function with a body, input and output like this:\n\n```\ndef function_name(input_parameter):\n    <body of function that uses input_argument>\n    return output\n```\n\n### Print vs. Output\nReturn vs. Display: The return statement is used to give back a value from a function, which can be used later, while print is used to display a value to the console only for the programmer to see.\n","tokenCount":186,"range":{"start":0,"end":825}}]}
