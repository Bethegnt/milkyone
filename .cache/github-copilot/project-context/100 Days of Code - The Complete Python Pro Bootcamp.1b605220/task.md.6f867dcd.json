But randomness is very important when building software, especially games. It would be really boring if every move in a video game was pre-determined.\n\nSo, some computer scientists invented pseudorandom number generators. e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister\n\nIf you want to learn more about pseudorandom number generators, I recommend watching this video by Khan Academy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtOt7EBNEwQ&ab_channel=KhanAcademyLabs\n\n### The Random module in Python\nRead the docs here:\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html\n\nTo use it you need to first import it:\n\n`import random`\n\n### Random Whole Numbers Within a Range\n\n```\nimport random\nrand_num = random.randint(1, 10)\n\n#This will produce a random whole number between 1 and 10 (inclusive).\n```\n### Modules in Python\nPython allows us to put code into different files and import that code if needed. This means that we can better organise and modularise our code. \n\nYou can create a new module simply by creating a new `.py` file, and then you can import variables or functions from that file just by using the `import` keyword.\n\n### Random Floats\nYou can generate a random number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (not inclusive) using the following code from the random module:\n\n```\nimport random\nrand_num_0_to_1 = random.random()\n```\nIt can also be represented like this\n\n`0.0 <= random.random() < 1.0`\n\nYou can expand the range of random numbers generated by this method using multiplication.\n\ne.g. `random.random() * 5`\n\nWill generate a random number between 0 and 5. \n\nAnother way to generate random floating point numbers is to use the `uniform()` function.\n\n```\nimport random\nrandom_float = random.uniform(1, 10)\n#This will generate a random floating point number between 1 and 10. \n```\nThis method may or may not include the upper bound depending on the rounding of the floating point number.\nSo it's best represented as:\n\n`a <= random.uniform(a,b) <= b`\n\nSo depending on if you want the upper bound included you will choose whether to use","tokenCount":500,"range":{"start":0,"end":2146}},{"id":"file:///Users/bethegnt/PycharmProjects/100%20Days%20of%20Code%20-%20The%20Complete%20Python%20Pro%20Bootcamp/Day%204/Random%20Module/task.md#375","chunk":"random.random() * 5`\n\nWill generate a random number between 0 and 5. \n\nAnother way to generate random floating point numbers is to use the `uniform()` function.\n\n```\nimport random\nrandom_float = random.uniform(1, 10)\n#This will generate a random floating point number between 1 and 10. \n```\nThis method may or may not include the upper bound depending on the rounding of the floating point number.\nSo it's best represented as:\n\n`a <= random.uniform(a,b) <= b`\n\nSo depending on if you want the upper bound included you will choose whether to use `random.random()` or `random.uniform()`.\n\n### PAUSE 1 - Heads or Tails\nCreate a coin flip program using what you have learnt about randomisation in Python. It should randomly print \"Heads\" or \"Tails\" everytime it is run. \n\n<div class=\"hint\">\n  You'll need to think about what you have learnt about conditional statements in Python.\n</div>","tokenCount":204,"range":{"start":1602,"end":2485}}]}
