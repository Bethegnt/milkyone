You give it name and then when you call the function by that name, all the code within the function block will be executed. It can help us save time and reduce repeated code.\n\n### Defining a new Function\n```\ndef <function name>():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    # Do something else\n    # Do something else ...\n```\n\n### Calling a Function\nCalling a function just means triggering the function. We can call a function at any point in our code in Python. \n\n```\n<function name>()\n```\n\nPutting everything together e.g.\n```\n#Creating the function\ndef get_user_name():\n    name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name)\n    # Inside the function\n\n#Outside the function\nprint(\"Hello\")\nget_user_name() # Calling the function\n```\n\nThis code will result in the following sequence of output:\n```\nHello\nWhat is your name? #I type Angela\nHello\nAngela\n```","tokenCount":219,"range":{"start":0,"end":925}}]}
