In each step, there will be multiple TODOs. Your goal is to go through each todo in order and complete them.\n\nYou can view all the todos easily in PyCharm by going to View -> Tool Windows -> TODOs\n\n### TODO-1 \nRandomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called `chosen_word`. Then print it.\n\n### TODO-2 \nAsk the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called `guess`. Make the String stored in `guess` lowercase.\n\n<div class=\"hint\">\n  Search Google for the lower() function in Python.\n</div>\n\n\n### TODO-3 \nCheck if the letter the user guessed `guess` is one of the letters in the `chosen_word`. Loop through each of the letters in the `chosen_word`  and print \"Right\" if the letter is a match, \"Wrong\" if it's not.\n\n<div class=\"hint\">\n  You can loop through Strings the same way you can loop through Lists - by using the `for in` loop.\n    Try Googling: \"Loop through strings python\"\n</div>\n\n\n","tokenCount":287,"range":{"start":0,"end":1198}}]}
