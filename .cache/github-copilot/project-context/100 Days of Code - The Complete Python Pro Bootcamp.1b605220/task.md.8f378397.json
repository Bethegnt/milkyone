If you write code below the return statement that code will not be executed.\n\nHowever, you can have multiple return statements in one function. So how does that work?\n\n### Conditional Returns\n\nWhen we have control flow, as in the code will behave differently (go down different execution paths) depending on certain conditional checks, we can end up with multiple endings (returns).\n\ne.g.\n```\ndef canBuyAlcohol(age):\n    if age >= 18:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n### Empty Returns\nYou can also write return without anything afterwards, and this just tells the function to exit.\n\ne.g.\n```\ndef canBuyAlcohol(age):\n    # If the data type of the age input is not a int, then exit.\n    if type(age) != int:\n        return\n\n    if age >= 18:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```","tokenCount":194,"range":{"start":0,"end":863}}]}
