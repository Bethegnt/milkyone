One of them helps us calculate the sum (the total).\ne.g.\n```\nstudent_scores = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]\ntotal_score = sum(student_scores) \n```\nBut how does `sum()` work behind the scenes? The code is written by the people who developed Python and it might look something like this:\n\n```\nstudent_scores = [180, 124, 165]\n\nsum = 0\nfor score in student_scores:\n    sum += score\n    \nprint(sum)\n```\n\n\n\n### PAUSE 1 - Max\nThere are also a built-in Python methods called `max()` and `min()`, which allow you to pass in a List of numbers, and it will give you the highest number or the lowest number.\n\nYour job is to figure out how the Python programmers might have built this functionality using loops and conditionals.\n\n## COMPLETE THIS CHALLENGE WITHOUT USING max()\n\nYou are given a list of exam scores, and you have to print out the highest score from the List.\nYou will need to use what you have learnt about Lists, For Loops and Conditionals to print out the highest score in the list of student_scores.\nFor example, if the scores were:\n```\n8 65 89 86 55 91 64 89\n```\nYour code should print\n```\n91\n```\n\n","tokenCount":304,"range":{"start":0,"end":1187}}]}
