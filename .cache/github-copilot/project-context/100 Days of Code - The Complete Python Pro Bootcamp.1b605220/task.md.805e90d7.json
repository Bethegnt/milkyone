Tommy\"\n```\n\n### Inputs are Variables\nWhen you create a function with inputs, you are defining a variable name that will be given to the data that is passed in.\n\nThe name of the input variable, e.g. `name` in this code here: `def greet(name):` is called the parameter.\n\nThe value of the value of the input variable, e.g. `Angela` when you call the previous `greet` function: `greet(\"Angela\")` is called the argument.
